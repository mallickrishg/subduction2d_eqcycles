# subduction2d_eqcycles
 
Impose periodic earthquakes and see how the system responds to it by accelerated/decelerated creep. The geometry is a two-dimensional subduction zone setup (plane strain), and the deforming areas of the mantle have been collapsed onto a zero-width shear zone (a fault) to ease computations.

The response of a fault to stress change/evolution is described by rate-strengthening friction while the behaviour of the oceanic and arc mantle are described by viscous rheology. It currently only has Maxwell rheology, but I will soon upgrade it to power-law.
